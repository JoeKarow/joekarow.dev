# [JoeKarow.dev](https://joekarow.dev) - Personal Portfolio Site
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/62dec45a-4dd7-40ed-ae99-0531678d3726/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/joekarow/deploys)



### Technologies used:

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I've been experimenting with the NEAT stack based off of the [NEAT Starter repo](https://github.com/surjithctly/neat-starter) and using it to build out my personal portfolio site. This is the first CMS I've developed with and I figured why not turn my learning experience in to the beginnings of my portfolio.

#### So far I've:
* Integrated a template design from [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/) in to 11ty.
* Learned how to make git branches, open pull requests, and merge branches.
* Loops, if statements and a few other things using the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating engine.
* Modify the Netlify CMS backend to author blog posts, edit the details for the projects section.
* Cried.
* Laughed.
* Swore a bit.
